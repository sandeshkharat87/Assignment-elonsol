# Porject 1
1. For project 1 Mediapipe is Used
2. Mediapipe can give better FPS as compared to other Object (Hand) Detection model
3. Open-cv techinues are check if Hand crosses the line or not
4. If hand crosses the line then Hands ROI color changes to -> Red

# Project 2
1. For porject 2 (Bangle Defect Detection ) images are collected from Kaggle
2. Then  made annotation on the dataset
3. Train YOLOv8 model for bangle defect Detection
4. if bangle is defected then rectagnle is created on the image
5. Used SORT (Object Tracking Techniuqe) to keep track of defect
6. To used this model for "Video Analysis" , I made a custom video to so model could detect on
    video
